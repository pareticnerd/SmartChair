# SmartChair
Prototype for open-source, extensible, cost-effective integration of SBC with a base-model power wheelchair

## Welcome!

Details about the initial repo structure:

	- CAD
		- CAD files, cura projects, .stl triangle mesh exports, gcode, and notes related to the 3d printing process
	- code
		- all code have written, that will contribute directly to software that is one day intended to be end-user friendly (as opposed to rough draft scripts, tests, dependencies etc)
	- deps
		- dependencies
	- doc
		- both end-user (eventually) and developer-oriented documentation, notwithstanding short notes relating to the development process of a component of the project (eg. the aforementioned 3d printing notes), which will instead be kept in the highest-level directory containing *all* of the components relevant to that note, that also includes as few non-related components as possible
	- scripts
		- scripts that are used in the development process, that may or may not work or make sense, that would not conventionally be included in an end-user product
	- LICENSE
		- a copy of the GNU General Public License Agreement, v3.0
	- README.md
		- documents the basic usage of the contents of this directory, the project mandate, organizatioon of the repo etc. (this document)
